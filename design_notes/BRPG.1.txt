The purpose of this little game

It showcases a lot of features, especially if we later add some basic mods to complement it (extra tiles, an extra npc or item, maybe another skill.
If this idea is approved I will spend some more time on the maths and balance (this is just a rough idea).  We have an artist who can do icons and tiles.
