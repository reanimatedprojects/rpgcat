##Actions

All actions have an ap cost, this is 1 unless otherwise indicated.  An AP check is performed before an action is takenm failure of the ap check results in no action being taken.  All actions save revival also check if the player is alive.

#Search
Checks if player inventory is full.  If not then: subtracts 1 ap; gets the current tile's item pool; does a random number generation based on that item pool max; awards item based on weighted table check.  Otherwise, gives error message.
#Give
Identical to shartak give function.
#Drop
0ap cost, identical to shartak drop function.
#Herb hunt action
Only visible on forest tiles.  Same as search but with a fixed item pool (50% herb find rate, 0% anything else).
#Speak
0.1ap cost, identical to shartak speak function (minus language complexity)
#Fletch
Checks player inventory contains a stick and a stone, if so subtracts one of each and gives the player two arrows.

#Attack
Identical to shartak attack function save that it can take 3 extra parameters.  AP modifier (for increased AP costs), accuracy modifier, damage modifier.  These all default to 1.
#Aimed Shot
Uses attack code but with a +1 ap modifier and a *2 accuracy modifier
#Sword Charge
Uses attack code but with a *2 damage modifier and a *2 accuracy modifier

#Rest
Can only be used on campfire tiles.  Costs 10ap and moves a player's spawn location to the campfire tile.
#Ask
Can only be used by NPCs with a quest.  Functionality should allow player to undertake quest, not too sure on how we will best do this.

##Some maths

Sword 0 skill 0.4 damage per ap (dwarf 0.5, elf 0.3)
Sword 1 skill 0.6 damage per ap (dwarf 0.8, elf 0.5)
Sword 2 skill 0.9 damage per ap (dwarf 1, elf 0.8)

Bow 0 skill 0.6 damage per ap (dwarf 0.48, elf 0.72)
Bow 1 skill 0.9 damage per ap (dwarf 0.78, elf 1.02)
